# README.md File For DSI Unix and Git Course

Date of Project Start: November 1, 2022

Name of Project: Workshop Assignment for Lillian Sung - Unix and Git DSI Course
Description: To learn about git and remote repositories is the purpose of the course. The actual repo includes a shell script that takes the parking_data.csv file as a positional parameter from the terminal as input, prints out all types of parking infractions, and uses awk to print the mean, min and max set_fine_amount. It then saves one type of parking infarction (PARK PROHIBITED TIME NO PERMIT) as a separate csv file, and shows set_fine_amount and location2 with the same headings as the original csv.

Usages: Only educational in this example

Installation: Fork my repo and create a pull request. You need a copy of the Toronto parking ticket data at Toronto's Open Data Portal:
https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/parking-tickets/

Support: Email me at lillian.sung@sickkids.ca

Contributing: Just me I guess with a fork from my partner Filip.!
